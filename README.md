# BSL++ shaders 
##### Based off of [BSL v7.1.02.2 by Capt Tatsu](https://bitslablab.com)

### Overview
Custom BSL shaders that enjoy the performance boost of BSL while still having more physically accurate water shaders present in other major shaders like Kuda. Since this is mostly a personal project, I removed features that I do not use: RP Support, Cel Shading, Lightmap Banding. 

### Key Changes
- Water:
    - refraction
    - multiplicative color
    - volumetric fog
    - tweaked water surface function
- General Transparency:
    - multiplicative color
    - reflective glass and ice
- Lighting:
    - support for greater dynamic range
    - tweaked sky gradients
    - tweaked light parameters
    - tweaked rain blending
